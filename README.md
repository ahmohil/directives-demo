# Angular Directives Demo

This project demonstrates the implementation and usage of custom Angular directives. It was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.14.

## Custom Directives Included

1. **Highlight Directive** - Changes background color of elements on hover
2. **Unless Directive** - Structural directive that works opposite to *ngIf
3. **Click Outside Directive** - Detects clicks inside or outside an element
4. **Delay Render Directive** - Delays rendering of elements for a specified time

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Alternatively, you can use `npm run dev` or `npm start` as configured in package.json.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
